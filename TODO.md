# TODO

* Use name/presentation name for objects 
* Check OIDC groups and how to use them to limit access, probably using another crd, e.g. rules
* Filter services and/or other objects by annotations
* Replace ad-hoc maps to Properly defined CRD with generated code
* Helm deployment
* Honor service settings for redirect (maybe combine with annotations)

# DONE

* Subscribe to single object (filter?)
